## Overview

Medical insurance costs can vary significantly based on demographic and health-related factors. This project uses machine learning, specifically linear regression, to analyze patterns and predict costs based on the following features:  

- **Age**  
- **Sex**  
- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)  
- **Number of Children**  
- **Smoker Status**  
- **Region**

## Model
The predictive system is built using Linear Regression, a fundamental regression technique.
Steps:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training the model on the training data.
- Evaluating the model using metrics R square.
